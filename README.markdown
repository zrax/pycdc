# Decompyle++ 
***A Python Byte-code Disassembler/Decompiler***

Decompyle++ aims to translate compiled Python byte-code back into valid
and human-readable Python source code. While other projects have achieved
this with varied success, Decompyle++ is unique in that it seeks to
support byte-code from any version of Python.

Decompyle++ includes both a byte-code disassembler (pycdas) and a 
decompiler (pycdc).

As the name implies, Decompyle++ is written in C++.

## Building Decompyle++
* Generate a project or makefile with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) (See CMake's documentation for details)
  * The following options can be passed to CMake to control debug features:

    | Option | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Produce debugging symbols |
    | `-DENABLE_BLOCK_DEBUG=ON` | Enable block debugging output |
    | `-DENABLE_STACK_DEBUG=ON` | Enable stack debugging output |

* Build the generated project or makefile
  * For projects (e.g. MSVC), open the generated project file and build it
  * For makefiles, just run `make`
  * To run tests (on \*nix or MSYS), run `make check`

## Usage
**To run pycdas**, the PYC Disassembler:
`./pycdas [PATH TO PYC FILE]`
The byte-code disassembly is printed to stdout.

**To run pycdc**, the PYC Decompiler: 
`./pycdc [PATH TO PYC FILE]`
The decompiled Python source is printed to stdout.
Any errors are printed to stderr.

**Marshalled code objects**:
Both tools support Python marshalled code objects, as output from `marshal.dumps(compile(...))`.

To use this feature, specify `-c -v <version>` on the command line - the version must be specified as the objects themselves do not contain version metadata.
